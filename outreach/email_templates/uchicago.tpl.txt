Hi {first_name},

I’m Chris Low, a senior at UChicago in CS and Econ. I saw your path at {company} and it really stood out.

This summer I built APIs/dashboards at Wistron, and I’m now working as a Data Analyst with the Chicago Bulls. I’m interested in {role} role at {company} and would value any advice on the team or the process.

If you’re open to a quick chat, mornings or evenings US time usually work best for me.

Thanks,
Chris
